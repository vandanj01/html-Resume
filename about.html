<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Vandan Jain. I come from Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. I've done my schooling from Springfield School,
  and I'm presently a sophomore pursuing BTech in Computer Science & Engineering from Jaipur Engineering 
  College & Research Centre.</p>

<p>I've been an active participant in various academic and co-curricular activities both in school and in college. 
  From the fun-filled debates, quizzes, and basketball competetions in the school corrdiors, to the more
  professional summits and MUN conferences in the college halls, I always look forward to learning and 
  polishing my skills and capabilities. Trading and investment strategies, novels and documentaries fascinate me as well.</p>

<p>I am trying out various career domains, such as cloud computing, development, and machine learning to finally 
  befriend the one I deem is the most suitable one for me. I believe in transparency and follow the same by never 
trying to hide my weaknesses, rather working on them by reaching out for assistance. I aspire to become proficient
in my field of choice and serve my society and nation in the best of my capacity.  </p>
